## Pendulum1
This project is the first one for the fifth chapter of [Physics Simulation Manual](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf).
It simulates the pendulum, which has a rigid massless rod and a mass at the end of it. This simulation has no resistance
and only the gravity is taken into account.
